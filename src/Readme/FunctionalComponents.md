# Functional Components

A Functional component is a function that takes props and returns JSX

The key thing that makes this type of component different from a class component is the **lack of state and lifecycle methods**. This is why functional components are also commonly referred to as stateless components.

## Why use Functional Components?

- Functional components are easy to read
- Functional components are easy to test
- Functional components can potentially have a better performance
- Functional components are easy to debug
- Functional components are more reusable
