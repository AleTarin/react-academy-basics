## 3 - [Welcome](../components/Welcome.jsx)
  ### Props
  Props are used to pass data from parent to child or by the component itself. They are immutable and thus will not be changed.

  ### Funtional Component
  Function that returns a JSX object.
  Can receive props as argumesnts.
  Export the Funtional Component to use it on other parts of your app. 
  Outside of the return object it works the same as a normal JS function.

  ![State Props](https://scriptverse.academy/img/tutorials/reactjs-props-state.png)
  
  **In our app:**
  ``` javascript
  // Functional Component with prop object
  const Welcome = (props) => {
    return (
      <section>
        <h1>{`Welcome to ${props.name} !`}</h1>
        <img alt={props.name} src={props.image}></img>
      </section>
    );
  }
  ```
  ### Import and use components

  ``` javascript
  import Welcome from './Welcome';

  class App extends Component {
    constructor() {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        name: "React Academy",
        image: "https://media1.tenor.com/images/fe250a86e1dfa2648481e7da5ebd441b/tenor.gif?itemid=5510026"
      }
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <section> 
          <Welcome name={this.state.name} image={this.state.image}/>
        </section>
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  **Bonus: Fuctional Components:**
  The key thing that makes this type of component different from a class component is the **lack of state and lifecycle methods**. This is why functional components are also commonly referred to as stateless components.

  [Why Functional Components](https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-functional-components/)
  - Functional components are easy to read
  - Functional components are easy to test
  - Functional components can potentially have a better performance
  - Functional components are easy to debug
  - Functional components are more reusable
