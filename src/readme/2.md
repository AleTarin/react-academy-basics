  ### Class components
  You can also use an ES6 class to define a component. A class component is used for more complex components, between other things, it can have an state and react's lifecycles.
  It should have a render method (from react's lifecycles) that returns a JSX object.

  **In our app:**
  ``` javascript
  // Class component
  class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }

    // Render life cylcle
    render() {
      return ( 
        // JSX Object
        <section> 
          React Academy 
          <img 
            alt="image" 
            src="image url"/>
        </section>
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  ### JSX
  Its like HTML combined with JS.
  A JSX object should have a wrapper tag.
  Inside the wrapper you can add JS, use { <JS code> }, it will be evaluated and the result will appear on the final HTML.

  ### State
  Is used to store mutable data, or data that will change.
  It is private and fully controlled by the component.
  Define it in the contructor, since is the first life cycle method to be executed.

  **In our app:**
  ``` javascript
  class NavbarContainer extends Component {
    
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        name: "React Academy",
        image: "https://media1.tenor.com/images/fe250a86e1dfa2648481e7da5ebd441b/tenor.gif?itemid=5510026"
      }
    }
    
    render() {
      return ( 
        <section> 
          React Academy 
          <img 
            alt={this.state.name}
            src={this.state.image}/>
        </section>
      );
    }
  }
  ```
